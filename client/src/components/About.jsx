            I'm a B.Tech student at the Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Hyderabad, with a GPA of 8.5. My
            expertise lies in ReactJS, Python, SQL, and machine learning. I'm passionate about developing innovative
            solutions and have hands-on experience in creating e-commerce and game applications.

            Active on platforms like Leetcode, GitHub, and Hackerrank, I continuously challenge myself to improve my
            coding skills. With certifications in data science and AI, I'm always eager to learn and apply new
            technologies to solve real-world problems.
